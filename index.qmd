I am a child of the Black community, and I believe in respect, reciprocity, community and support, among other things. I work to bring equity, inclusion, accessibility, and social justice for historically minoritized people including Black, Indigenous, Latine, and other People of Color. My aim is to ensure that we all have a seat at the proverbial table, because it is the right thing to do. By training, I am a plant ecologist and I study how variation in plant traits influences how plants interact with each other, with their environment, and with microbes. A large part of my research is related to applications in restoration science and practice and I incorporate experimental research and synthesis to interrogate and improve our understanding of plants and their secrets.\

Evelyn is a restoration ecologist with a background in conservation genetics. Evelyn first got a taste of natural resource management working at Itasca State Park in Minnesota and as a student at Carleton College working in the Cowling Arboretum. She received her Ph.D. in Botany at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison, where she studied fern genetics and demography in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Following that, she worked at the Chicago Botanic Garden on diverse conservation projects, including studying the importance of evolutionary diversity in prairie restorations. She now works for Adaptive Restoration in Mount Horeb, WI, as a restoration ecologist and member of the fire crew.
