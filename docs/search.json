A bit longer than the subtitle above.\n\n\nOur Team\n\nDr. Alicia Foxx (she/her)\nChicago Botanic Gardens & Northwestern University\nWebsite | Publications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a child of the Black community, and I believe in respect, reciprocity, community and support, among other things. I work to bring equity, inclusion, accessibility, and social justice for historically minoritized people including Black, Indigenous, Latine, and other People of Color. My aim is to ensure that we all have a seat at the proverbial table, because it is the right thing to do. By training, I am a plant ecologist and I study how variation in plant traits influences how plants interact with each other, with their environment, and with microbes. A large part of my research is related to applications in restoration science and practice and I incorporate experimental research and synthesis to interrogate and improve our understanding of plants and their secrets.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Becky Barak\nNorthwestern University\nWebsite | Publications | ResearchGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Becky Barak information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information .\n\n\n\nRegina Mae Francia (pronouns)\nAffiliation\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Hollis (pronouns)\nAffiliation\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Holly Jones (she/her)\nNorthern Illinois University\nWebsite | Publications | Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jones is a Professor at Northern Illinois University.
